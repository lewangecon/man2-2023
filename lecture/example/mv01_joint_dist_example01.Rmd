# Joint Distributions

Here we will play a dice game, **Craps**, as we did last semester, to illustrate concepts related to **Joint** and **Marginal** Distributions

```{r}
# Step 1: Simulate Data first 
set.seed(123456) 
x<-sample(1:6,100000, replace = T) 
y<-sample(1:6,100000, replace = T)
```

**Review Questions:**

1. Why `set.seed()`?
2. What does `sample(, , replace = T)` mean?
3. From the simulation design, can $x$ and $y$ be related?


```{r}
# Step 2: Calculate counts for each cell 
mytable<-table(x,y)
mytable
```


```{r}
# Step 2.b
# Alternatively, combine these two into a data frame 
data<-as.data.frame(cbind(x,y)) 
head(data)
```

```{r}
mytable<-xtabs(~ x+y, data=data)
mytable
```

From `R` documentation [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/xtabs), note that `xtabs` is an `R` command to perform cross tabulation, which creates a contingency table (optionally a sparse matrix) from cross-classifying factors, usually contained in a data frame, using a formula interface with the cross-classifying variables (separated by `+`) on the right hand side (or an object which can be coerced to a formula). 

Interactions are not allowed. On the left hand side, one may optionally
give a vector or a matrix of counts; in the latter case, the columns are interpreted as corresponding to the levels of a variable. This is useful if the data have already been tabulated, as above. 


```{r}
# Step 3: Cell proportions 
prop.table(mytable)
```

# Visualization of Joint Distributions

## Vsiualization in 3D

```{r}
# Install the package if you have not done so
# install.packages("plot3D")
library(plot3D)
```

```{r}
hist3D(z=mytable, border="black", space = .8)
```


## Visualization in 2D and Mosaic Plot 

We now use **Mosaic plot ** to visualize the joint distribution. To use the command for this purpose, we need to install the `vcd` package. 

```{r}
# Install the necessary packages first
# install.packages("vcd")
```

### Equal Probability

Lets visualize the joint distribution with **equal probability** for each pair of $x$ and $y$ values.

```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(mytable, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE)

```


### Unequal Probability

Lets simulate a case where the probabilities are unequally distributed over the space of the pairs of $x$ and $y$ values.


```{r}
set.seed(123456)
x<-sample(0:1,100000, replace = T, prob=c(.2,.8)) 
data<-data.frame(x, y=NA)
head(data)
```

Lets simulate some relationship between $x$ and $y$
```{r}
data$y[data$x == 1] <- sample(0:1, sum(data$x == 1), replace = T, prob=c(0.7,0.3)) 
data$y[data$x == 0] <- sample(0:1, sum(data$x == 0), replace = T, prob=c(0.1,0.9)) 
head(data)
```

Now, lets calculate the counts for each pair of values

```{r}
mytable<-xtabs(~ x+y, data=data)
mytable
```

Lets convert these counts to probabilities to obtain the joint distribution.

```{r}
prop.table(mytable)
```


Once we obtain the joint distribution (counts for each cell), we can now visualize it
```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(mytable, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE)
```

What do we learn here? We learn two things (which combination is more likely):

1. $X = 1;Y = 0$ is most likely, while $X = 0;Y = 0$ least likely
2. We will use this to examine the conditional probability (defined later) as well.

## Visualization in 2D and Contour Plot

[Contour plots | Multivariable calculus | Khan Academy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsZj5Rb6do8)

A contour plot is a graphical representation of a three-dimensional surface, where the x and y axis represent the independent variables and the z axis represents the dependent variable. The contour plot shows the levels of the dependent variable (usually represented by different colors or shades) in relation to the independent variables. Contour lines connect points of equal value and are often used to identify regions of constant value or to show the slope of the surface. The closer the contour lines are together, the steeper the slope. The farther apart the contour lines are, the flatter the slope.

```{r}

```

## Visualization in 2D and Tile Plot


```{r message=FALSE}
#install.packages("plotly")
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
data %>%  
  count(x,y) %>%    
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +   
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

# Joint Distribution to Marginal Distribution

```{r}
prop.table(mytable)
addmargins(prop.table(mytable))
```

# Joint Distribution for Continuous Variables

```{r message=FALSE}
remotes::install_version("kubik", version = "0.3.0")
remotes::install_version("barsurf", version = "0.7.0")
remotes::install_version("bivariate", version = "0.7.0")
library(bivariate)
```


```{r}
# Simulate data from multivariate normal
set.seed(123456)
data <-  MASS::mvrnorm(n = 50, 
                mu = c(1, 5),
                Sigma = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), nrow = 2),
                empirical = TRUE)
colnames(data) <- c("x", "y")
data <- as.data.frame(data)



```



```{r}
# Calculate nonparametric joint density (bandwidths)
f <- kbvpdf (data$x, data$y, 0.7, 7)
plot (f, TRUE, xlab="x", ylab="y")
```

## Approach 1: 3-d Joint Density Function

```{r}
library(MASS)

dens <- kde2d(data$x,data$y)

persp(dens, phi = 30, theta = 40, expand = .9,
      xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", zlab = "Z")

```


## Approach 2: Contour Plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  stat_density2d(mapping = aes(fill = after_stat(level)),
                 geom = "polygon",
                 color = "white"
                 )+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.975, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.915, color = "red")
```
